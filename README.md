# DNA Forensics

DNA_Forensics is a program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs. The program takes as its argument a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify. The program should return the name of an individual having a DNA sequence to the provided sequence in the case of a match.
